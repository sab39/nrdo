        <h1>
            Recipe File Format Specification</h1>
        <p>
            A recipe file is an xml document containing records to be loaded into the database.
            The root element of the xml must always be &lt;nrdo.recipe&gt;. Within this, each
            element corresponds to a database record.</p>
        <p>
            Note: This document deliberately does not specify an xml namespace in which its
            elements are defined. This is because the set of elements that are legal depends
            entirely on what tables are defined in the project in question. Implementation-wise,
            any project using nrdo can specify its own recipe namespace, and nrdo will generate
            a schema for that namespace defining the elements for tables in that project. The
            recipe loader will ignore the namespace - even if no namespace is specified at all
            - and process elements based only on their local name.</p>
        <h2>
            Raw vs Friendly format</h2>
        <p>
            The engine that processes recipe files is fairly simple and expects each record
            to be listed sequentially in such a way that the processing can be done one record
            at a time, without any complex dependency evaluation. Such a recipe is called a
            <em>raw format</em> recipe. Because that format isn't terribly convenient to write,
            an expanded, more friendly format is also available. Everything that's legal in
            a raw format recipe is also legal in a <em>friendly format</em> recipe, but in the
            friendly format the relationships between records can be represented more directly
            using nesting and attributes. When processing, nrdo transforms the friendly format
            recipe into raw format before loading it.</p>
        <p>
            First, the elements common to both raw and friendly format will be described, then
            the additional features available in friendly format will be covered.</p>
        <h2>
            Tables</h2>
        <p>
            Inside the &lt;nrdo.recipe&gt; element each child element must correspond to a database
            table. The name of the element is the full dfn-file syntax name of the table, with
            ":" replaced by ".". For example, a table called core:panel_type (from a Core/panel_type.dfn
            file) would be represented by a &lt;core.panel_type&gt; element, and core:access:target
            (from Core/Access/target.dfn) by &lt;core.access.target&gt;.</p>
        <h2>
            Context and the nrdo.id Attribute</h2>
        <p>
            Every element inside the recipe may have a nrdo.id attribute, and in the case of
            tables with a sequenced primary key, this attribute is required (with one exception
            in friendly format, see 'References as Nested Elements' below). The value of this
            field uniquely identifies the record to the recipe processing engine. The value
            may be any valid xml identifier except that it may not contain ".".</p>
        <p>
            The mapping between nrdo.id values and database records is stored in the <em>recipe
                context</em>. At minimum, the recipe context persists for the duration of loading
            the recipe, but in most cases applications will choose to save it and reuse the
            same context to load future recipes into the same database. What's stored in the
            context for each record consists of the nrdo.id value, and some set of field values
            including at minimum the values of the primary key fields. The context may also
            keep track of which fields are known to <em>exist</em> for a particular record even
            if no value for that field is known. This allows future recipes to distinguish between
            the case where a field was newly added to the database versus the case where no
            recipe has ever affected the value of the field for that record.</p>
        <p>
            It is not illegal for the same record (with the same nrdo.id value) to be referred
            to more than once within the same context, or even within the same recipe. If it
            is, that record will simply be processed twice - this can on occasion be useful.
            It IS, however, illegal to try to use the same nrdo.id value to refer
            to records on two different tables. This will be detected when trying to add the
            second use to the context and the recipe will fail to load.</p>
        <p>
            When looking up a record based on nrdo.id, unless the record has already been retrieved
            (or modified) during this recipe load, the record will be retrieved from the database
            based on primary key. If no result is returned, the record will be removed from
            the context and the behavior will be identical to what would happen if the record
            was not known in the context at all.</p>
        <p>
            Since this depends on being able to call the primary key getter, tables with "nocode"
            specified on the pkey in the dfn file cannot be used in recipes.</p>
        <h2>
            Fields and Field Values</h2>
        <p>
            For each field defined on the table, an attribute can be specified on the element
            with the name of the field and the value that field should take. If the attribute
            value starts with ":", it is treated specially and parsed by nrdo; otherwise, it
            will be converted by the .NET framework's TypeDescriptor.GetConverter method for
            the type of the field in question. Which means that string fields will accept the
            value as-is, integer fields will go through the equivalent of int.Parse, DateTime
            through DateTime.Parse etc.</p>
        <p>
            Values starting in ":" will be interpreted as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Values starting in "::" will have the first ":" stripped off and then be parsed
                by GetConverter, so a literal value that starts with ":" can be included in a recipe
                by adding an extra ":" in front.</li>
            <li>The special value ":null" corresponds to a database null</li>
            <li>A value of the form ":x.y" will be interpreted as follows: a record with nrdo.id "x"
                will be looked up in the context. If no such record is found, the result is a special
                <em>undefined</em> value. Otherwise, that record is fetched from the database based
                on the primary key value for it saved in the context (and if, again, it can't be
                found, the value is undefined). Otherwise, the result is the value of the field
                called "y" on that object. It is an error if there is no field called "y".</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Relationship between nrdo.id and primary key</h2>
        <p>
            If a value is given for all fields of the primary key, then the record will be looked
            up in the context based on those values as well as based on the nrdo.id if specified.
            Every element must specify either a nrdo.id or values for all the primary key fields.
            For this purpose, a field that evaluated as undefined is treated as not having been
            specified. Furthermore, if the record is not found in the context based on the primary
            key, it is also looked up in the database (this is equivalent to nrdo.find.by lookup
            described below, but done sooner). Either way, the lookup based on primary key must
            not contradict the lookup based on nrdo.id. Specifically, it is an error if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The nrdo.id was specified, but the primary key lookup found a record with a different
                nrdo.id.</li>
            <li>The primary key was specified, but the nrdo.id lookup found a record where one or
                more fields of the primary key were different.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the nrdo.id is specified, but the record in the context, found by primary key
            lookup, did not have a nrdo.id, then the specified nrdo.id is associated with that
            record thereafter.</p>
        <h2>
            Mapping to an existing record using nrdo.find</h2>
        <p>
            A record in the database may already be present as a result of something other than
            running a recipe. This will be particularly important for attempting to use recipes
            in the context of applications built against pre-recipe versions of nrdo, but can
            apply in other situations also. The recipe infrastructure therefore provides a way
            to locate an existing database record and put it in the context associated with
            a particular nrdo.id.</p>
        <p>
            If the attribute nrdo.find.by is present on an element, its value must be the name
            of a get defined on the table. This is the nrdo-level name rather than the C# name,
            so to refer to the get that C# calls GetById, the value specified should be "id".
            The get in question must be a single get, and define no params and no fields other
            than on the current table. Also, for each field specified in the get, that attribute
            must be present on the element (although in the case of friendly syntax, it may
            be implicit based on a reference rather than explicit, see the discussion of references
            below). Before processing the element, if the nrdo.id is not already known in the
            context, the recipe engine will invoke the specified
            get with the field values specified in the attributes (however, if any of those
            values evaluate to <em>undefined</em>, this step will be skipped). If a non-null
            value is returned, the primary key of that value will be looked up in the context.
            If it is found there, an error is reported, as it must have a different nrdo.id
            (or it would have been found by nrdo.id lookup in an earlier step), and this is
            illegal. Otherwise, it is added to the context with its primary key will associated
            with the specified nrdo.id.
            Processing then continues as normal regardless of whether it was found or not.</p>
        <p>
            If the attribute nrdo.find.where is present on an element [NOTE: this may not be
            implemented in the first release, only if it turns out to be necessary], it will
            be interpreted as a where clause for an sql statement to look up the primary key
            of the record in question. That is, nrdo.find.by="id" id="15" is more or less equivalent
            to nrdo.find.where="id=15". This allows searches more complex than those possible
            using nrdo.find.by, but is not recommended in general. As a workaround until this
            is implemented, add a get on the table with the appropriate "where" clause and use
            it in nrdo.find.by.</p>
        <p>
            A corollary of the rules dictating which situations result in errors is that if
            all the fields of the primary key are specified, nrdo.find.by and nrdo.find.where
            are useless: either redundant (if the pkey get is specified) or illegal (if any
            record might be returned OTHER than the one that the pkey get would return).
            Therefore it is illegal to specify them in that case.</p>
        <p>
            Neither nrdo.find.by nor nrdo.find.where can be specified on an element that does not
            have a nrdo.id.</p>
        <h2>
            Specifying constraints using nrdo.exists</h2>
        <p>
            It may be useful to specify requirements related to the state of the database, particularly,
            to avoid unintentionally inserting a row when the intention was to simply look up
            information about it. If that row isn't present it would generally be preferable
            to report an error rather than adding it. Similarly it may be that this recipe would
            clash with some other information if present, so it's preferable to report an error
            than attempt to blindly continue.</p>
        <p>
            If the attribute nrdo.exists is present on an element, it may have one of the three
            values "required", "permitted", or "error". If the value is "required", an error
            will be reported unless the record corresponding to that element exists in the database
            and the context. If the value is "error", an error will be reported IF the record
            corresponding to that element exists in the database and the context. If the value
            is "permitted" or this attribute is absent entirely, the record will be used if
            present, but processing will continue regardless.&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>
            Specifying what to do using nrdo.action</h2>
        <p>
            Once this point in processing is reached for each element in the recipe, we now
            have a set of field values and know whether the record corresponds to an existing
            row in the database, or not - and if so, we have the corresponding object in memory.
            What happens next depends on the value of the nrdo.action attribute, if present;
            if not, the default behavior is equivalent to nrdo.action="update".</p>
        <ul>
            <li>nrdo.action="none" - Only nrdo.id, nrdo.find and nrdo.exists attributes can be specified
                and any fields needed for nrdo.find. The context is updated to associate the nrdo.id
                with the primary key of the record, if applicable, and nothing else is done.</li>
            <li>nrdo.action="ensure" - If the record already exists, all field attributes are ignored
                and the behavior is the same as "none". Otherwise a new record is created and associated
                with the context based on the values of all the field attributes.</li>
            <li>nrdo.action="update" - If the record exists, any fields where the value is stored
                in the context and matches the database will be updated to the value specified in
                the attribute if one is present, but if the context doesn't store a value or the
                value already matches it'll be left alone. If the record doesn't exist, it's created.
                This is the default behavior.</li>
            <li>nrdo.action="replace" - All the fields that are specified in attributes are updated,
                regardless of what's in the context. The values are saved as known in the context
                too. If the record doesn't exist, it's created.</li>
            <li>nrdo.action="delete" - If the record exists, it's deleted. Like "none", only nrdo.id,
                nrdo.find and nrdo.exists attributes can be specified and any fields needed for
                nrdo.find. The context is updated to remove all reference to this record.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the undefined value shows up in any field which is to be set, it is an error,
            unless the field is a sequenced pkey. If a value is present for a sequenced pkey
            field on a record that doesn't exist, that's also an error. Readonly fields, in
            general, are only set for newly created records; they will be ignored for existing
            records, except for purposes of looking up the record by primary key or nrdo.find.by.
            It is, however, an error to specify a readonly field that is <em>not</em> being
            used for one of those two purposes if nrdo.exists="required".</p>
        <p>
            Not all readonly fields need be specified for new records; any omitted fields will
            take the C# default value for their type.</p>
        <h2>
            References as attribute</h2>
        <p>
            One "friendly" feature that is available in raw format is the ability to describe
            certain kinds of reference relationships explicitly, rather than needing to specify
            the individual field or fields that make up the reference. Only the simplest kinds
            of reference can be described this way, however,
            and it's helpful to define explicitly exactly which references those are.</p>
        <p>
            A reference is <em>eligible</em> if it's a single reference, contains no extra tables,
            fields or parameters, and all joins are directly from the source table to the destination
            table ("joins {* to *}", or "by"). The reference name refers to the nrdo-level name,
            which (for any reference meeting these criteria of eligible) is the name of the
            destination table, unless "called" is specified. Note that this definition of eligible
            is also used in several friendly format features.</p>
        <p>
            If an eligible reference exists from a table, an attribute with the name of that
            reference can be given specifying the nrdo.id of a record on the destination table.
            This is equivalent to setting the field(s) involved in the reference
            to the value of the corresponding field on the named record. For example, if the
            core:template table has:</p>
        <p>
            references single core:surface {fkey; by {surface_id id}};</p>
        <p>
            Then the line &lt;core.template surface="a_surface"/&gt; is equivalent to &lt;core.template
            surface_id=":a_surface.id"/&gt;. If more than one field is involved in the reference,
            all of them will be set the same way. It is illegal to specify any of the fields
            involved in the reference explicitly if a reference is specified in this way. It
            is also illegal for the referenced nrdo.id to refer to any table type other than
            the target table of the reference.</p>
        <h1>
            Friendly Format Features</h1>
        <p>
            In friendly format, all the same features are present as in raw, but some extra
            capabilities are available to make the relationships between tables easier to represent
            in an intuitive way. Since relationships between tables in nrdo are embodied as
            references, it's unsurprising that many of the friendly format features relate to references, and specifically to <em>eligible</em> references as defined above.</p>
        <h2>
            Field as nested element</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes the desired value for a string field is long, and may contain
            XML or HTML content that is annoying to put into an attribute due to the
            need to escape &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot; characters. In friendly format,
            any field whose C# type is "string" may appear as a nested element with the name
            of the field. If this element has the attribute "escaped" with the value "true",
            the content must be a string with no nested elements, and any XML-special characters
            must be escaped. Otherwise
            (if the "escaped" attribute is absent or has the value "false"), the content must be well-formed XML but does not need
            to be escaped. For example, if Core/layout.dfn contains a field</p>
        <pre>string content ntext nullable readwrite [the content of the layout];</pre>
        <p>
            then</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.layout nrdo.id="a_layout"&gt;
  &lt;content&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Heading&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/core.layout&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
            is equivalent to</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.layout nrdo.id="a_layout"&gt;
  &lt;content escaped="true"&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Heading&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/content&gt;
&lt;/core.layout&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
            which is in turn equivalent to</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.layout nrdo.id="a_layout" content="&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Heading&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;"/&gt;
</pre>
        <h2>
            References as nested element</h2>
        <p>
            Another common scenario is that two related elements are to be created together.
            If an eligible reference exists from a table to the sequenced primary key of another
            table, the corresponding element may have
            a nested element with the name of that reference. That will be transformed into
            a record of the target type which gets placed in front of the containing element,
            and the fields that make up the reference set accordingly. Also, in this situation
            (only!) the nrdo.id attribute is optional on the inner element, as long as a nrdo.id is
            specified (either explicitly or implied by this same rule) on the outer element;
            it will be automatically set to the nrdo.id of the container followed by "_"
            followed by the name of the reference. An example might help make this clear:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.template nrdo.id="a_template"&gt;
  &lt;surface/&gt;
&lt;/core.template&gt;
</pre>
<p>This will transform into:</p>
<pre>&lt;core.surface nrdo.id="a_template_surface"/&gt;
&lt;core.template nrdo.id="a_template" surface="a_template_surface"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>Which in turn as mentioned above (References as Attribute) is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>&lt;core.surface nrdo.id="a_template_surface"/&gt;
&lt;core.template nrdo.id="a_template" surface_id=":a_template_surface.id"/&gt;
</pre>
        <p>
            </p>
        <p>
            Any attributes on the &lt;surface&gt; element will be transparently moved to the
            &lt;core.surface&gt; element that gets created. nrdo.find.* attributes cannot be
            specified on the inner (&lt;surface&gt; in this case) elements.</p>
        <h2>
            Back-reference as nested element</h2>
        <p>
            If there is exactly one and only one eligible reference from one table to another,
            it is also possible to nest the elements the other way around. For example, if the
            core:panel_type table has a reference to core:feature, the following is permitted:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.feature nrdo.id="a_feature"&gt;
  &lt;panel_type nrdo.id="a_panel_type"/&gt;
&lt;/core.feature&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            will transform into:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.feature nrdo.id="a_feature"/&gt;
&lt;core.panel_type nrdo.id="a_panel_type" feature="a_feature"/&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            (the further transformation from feature= to feature_id= goes without saying by
            now)</p>
        <p>
            The rules as to what the nested element should be called in this case are a little
            complex, mainly because the right answer is "obvious" in each case but it's not
            so obvious what the set of rules is that gets there.</p>
        <p>
            Essentially, the "core." prefix can be removed as long as (a) that wouldn't result
            in a clash with an eligible reference on the containing table (<em>references as nested
                element</em> always takes precedence), (b) the containing table starts with the same module name
            - including that if the containing table is "store.coupons.coupon", tables with
            a "store." prefix can have it removed, as long as (c) that wouldn't result in a
            clash with another table that matches more of the prefix, eg if there was a "store.coupons."
            table with the same name as the "store." one. Also, for the purposes of simplifying
            the transform and simplifying intellisense, if a prefix <em>can</em> be removed
            this way, it must be.</p>
        <p>
            One more example of what this allows:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.template name="Basic Template"&gt;
  &lt;surface&gt;
    &lt;panel panel_type="layout_panel_type"&gt;
    &lt;panel panel_type="content_panel_type"&gt;
  &lt;/surface&gt;
&lt;/core.template&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            Notice how the nesting defines the relationships naturally even though both template
            and panel reference surface, and it will all transform into one linear list creating
            the surface first, then the template and the panels.</p>
        <h2>
            Interaction between references as nested element and nrdo.find</h2>
        <p>
            There's one particular interaction which requires some clever handling during the
            transform, best illustrated by an example from cmScribe. This is roughly how we
            will write a recipe to define panel types while also picking up the right ids for
            existing sites where the panel types have already&nbsp; been declared (although
            my current plan is to make the insertion of the target element automatic via a further
            transform done first, it'll still be there).</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.feature name="Core" nrdo.id="core_feature" nrdo.find.by="name"&gt;
  &lt;panel_type name="Welcome" nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type" source_file="Core/Welcome.ascx" nrdo.find.by="source_file"&gt;
    &lt;target target_class="panel_type_target_class"/&gt;
  &lt;/panel_type&gt;
&lt;/core.feature&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            The key is in the interaction between the panel type and the target. Taking out
            the irrelevant parts, we get:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.panel_type nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type" source_file="Core/Welcome.ascx" nrdo.find.by="source_file"&gt;<br />&nbsp; &lt;target target_class="panel_type_target_class"/&gt;<br />&lt;/core.panel_type&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            Which based on what has been discussed so far would transform into:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.access.target target_class="panel_type_target_class" nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type_target"/&gt;<br />&lt;core.panel_type nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type" source_file="Core/Welcome.ascx" nrdo.find.by="source_file" target="welcome_panel_type_target"&gt;</pre>
<p>
    This doesn't actually achieve the desired result, however, because it creates a
    brand new target record rather than finding the existing one. So in the case of
    a references-as-nested-element where the containing element has nrdo.find.by or
    nrdo.find.where specified, the transformed code turns into this instead:</p>
        <pre>&lt;core.panel_type nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type" source_file="Core/Welcome.ascx" nrdo.find.by="source_file" nrdo.action="none"&gt;
&lt;core.access.target target_class="panel_type_target_class" nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type_target" nrdo.find.by="id" id=":welcome_panel_type.target_id"/&gt;
&lt;core.panel_type nrdo.id="welcome_panel_type" source_file="Core/Welcome.ascx" target="welcome_panel_type_target"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
    The actual details of how that transform needs to happen are slightly hairy, but
    not terribly so, and they're worth implementing because they save an awful lot of
    complexity for the end user. The nrdo.action="none" causes the first panel_type
    record to only do the finding part, which allows the finding of the target record
    to succeed based on that target id if the record is present, or a new one inserted
    if not. Then finally the panel type gets inserted if it wasn't already present,
    or updated appropriately if it was.</p>
        <h2>
            Transformations</h2>
        <p>
            The recipe engine has built in support for applying user-defined transformations
            to the XML structure before loading it. The algorithm that is used is based on the
            recognition that raw format recipes are simpler and more predictable and hence easier
            to parse, but friendly format recipes are easier to write, and also to generate
            as the output of such transformations.</p>
        <p>
            A transformation is defined by a transformation type and (optionally) a source file.
            There is a built in transformation type called "xslt", for which the source file
            is required and specifies an xslt 'stylesheet' to apply to the XML. Other transformation
            types can be registered with the recipe engine before loading the recipe, which
            requires specifying a name and the fully qualified classname of a class that implements
            the ITransformRecipe interface. ITransformRecipe defines one read-write property
            SourceFile (which will be set to the source file of the transformation if one is
            specified) and one method, XmlDocument Transform(XmlDocument recipe). This method
            can return either the same document passed to it, after modifying it, or create
            a whole new document and return that. The document passed in is guaranteed to be
            a valid raw format recipe; the returned document will be interpreted as friendly
            format and can use the additional features available to friendly format recipes.</p>
        <p>
            Note: the application using recipes may support additional transformations applied
            to xml documents before the recipe engine ever sees them. cmScribe in particular
            will most likely do so.The recipe engine is unaware of such transformations, however,
            and they are outside the scope of this document, except to note that obviously,
            neither the input nor output of these transformations need be valid recipes until
            the very last transformation is reached - so they do not meet the contract for ITransformRecipe.</p>
        <p>
            Transformations that the recipe engine IS aware of come from two sources. Firstly,
            the application using the recipe engine may supply a list of transformations to
            the engine through the engine's API. Secondly, the recipe itself may define further
            transformations by including &lt;nrdo.transform&gt; elements. These must appear
            at the root of the &lt;nrdo.recipe&gt; element and before any table elements occur.
            Two attributes can be specified on &lt;nrdo.transform&gt;: type, and src. The type
            attribute specifies the type name of any registered transformation type; if omitted,
            it defaults to "xslt". The src attribute specifies the source file, which is required
            for xslt but may or may not be required for other transformation types.</p>
        <p>
            The algorithm by which the transformations are applied is best described by talking
            about a queue of transformations. The queue starts out containing the API-supplied
            list of transformations, in order. The recipe is then processed as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Convert the document from friendly format to raw format (the code that does this
                is not a "transformation" by the definition we're using here, but rather internal
                code). This involves translating all nested structures to the corresponding flat
                structures as described above, and <em>removing</em> all nrdo.transform elements.
                The transformations specified by those elements, though, are added to the <em>front</em>
                of the transformation queue.</li>
            <li>If the queue is empty, stop: we're done.</li>
            <li>Apply the transformation at the front of the queue.</li>
            <li>The output of the transformation is considered to be friendly format. So go back
                to step 1 to convert it to raw, and continue from there.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Clearly it is possible to create an infinite loop here by defining a transform that
            keeps inserting more and more transform tags. I don't think this would be easy to
            do accidentally, though, and a malicious recipe could already do a lot more harm
            than that.</p>
