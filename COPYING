Copyright license for nrdo

nrdo is distributed under two licenses: the GNU General Public License (GPL),
and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The GPL applies to the nrdo
development tools, and the LGPL to the nrdo runtime libraries. You can find a
copy of the GPL in the file COPYING.gpl, and the LGPL in the file COPYING.lgpl.

You may distribute and/or modify the files in nrdo under the terms of the
respective license. Each source code file indicates which license it is released
under. For informational purposes only, here is a summary of what licenses
apply to each source directory. In the case of a conflict between this summary
and the header of the source code file itself, the source code file is
authoritative.

There is a potential ambiguity with regard to the files in the templates/
directory - they are used to generate source code that contains a lot of text
from the templates themselves. If the templates are under the GPL, are these
source code files also covered by the GPL? Section 0, paragraph 2 of the GPL
says that the output of the program is only covered if it constitutes a work
based on the program, but doesn't discuss what conditions would make that true.

Since this situation is not made explicit in the terms of the license itself,
I will clarify explicitly: the GPL does not apply to source code files
generated from these templates. I consider these source code files to be
effectively the same as binary object code, where the source code is your .dfn
files. Since you unquestionably hold the copyright on your own .dfn files, you
also hold the copyright on the "object" code generated from it, even though it
includes some text from the template files.

Of course, if you want to modify the output source code beyond what is possible
from the .dfn file, you can either give up the automated maintenance provided
by nrdo, or change the template file. If you change the template file, then the
GPL does apply.

*One file in nrdo is imported from an external source: the
gnu.text.LineBufferedReader class, by Per Bothner. This file does not state its
license explicitly, and modifying the file to add a statement of its license
would require that all of nrdo be licensed under the GPL only, not LGPL.

available as src/gnu/text/COPYING):
